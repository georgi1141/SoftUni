// Write a JS function that rotates an array.The array should be rotated to the right side, meaning that the last element should become the first, upon rotation.

// The input comes as two parameters â€“ an array of strings and a number.The second parameter is the amount of rotation you need to perform.

// The output is the resulting array after the rotations.The elements should be printed on one line, separated by a single space.
